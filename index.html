                        <h2>Here is a timeline of Frederick the Great's life</h2>
                        <p><strong>1712</strong> - Born on January 24 in Berlin, Prussia, the son of King Frederick William I and Queen Sophia Dorothea of Hanover. Raised in a strict, militaristic household, he struggles under his father’s harsh discipline.</p>

                        <p><strong>1728</strong> - Begins secretly studying philosophy, music, and French literature, defying his father’s wishes for him to focus solely on military training.</p>

                        <p><strong>1730</strong> - Attempts to flee Prussia with his close friend Hans Hermann von Katte to escape his father’s oppressive rule. The plan fails, and his father forces him to witness Katte's execution, a trauma that deeply affects him for the rest of his life.</p>

                        <p><strong>1733</strong> - Marries Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in a political arrangement. Their relationship remains distant as Frederick finds greater passion in intellectual pursuits and statecraft.</p>

                        <p><strong>1740</strong> - Inherits the throne at the age of 28 after his father’s death. Almost immediately, he launches the invasion of Silesia, initiating the War of Austrian Succession and marking the start of his bold military campaigns.</p>

                        <p><strong>1745</strong> - Signs the Treaty of Dresden, securing Silesia for Prussia. His daring victories and strategic brilliance earn him respect and fear across Europe.</p>

                        <p><strong>1747</strong> - Moves into <i>Sanssouci</i>, his newly built retreat in Potsdam. It becomes the center of his personal and intellectual life, where he welcomes writers, philosophers, and thinkers like Voltaire and composes music on the flute.</p>

                        <p><strong>1756</strong> - Begins the <i>Seven Years’ War</i>, leading Prussia in a desperate struggle against Austria, Russia, and France. Despite being heavily outnumbered, his tactical genius ensures Prussia’s survival and solidifies its position as a major European power.</p>

                        <p><strong>1763</strong> - Ends the Seven Years’ War with the Treaty of Hubertusburg. Though the war strains Prussia’s resources, Frederick’s military reputation and territorial holdings remain intact, cementing his legacy as a great commander.</p>

                        <p><strong>1772</strong> - Gains new territories in the First Partition of Poland, a diplomatic triumph that expands Prussia’s borders without major conflict. His focus on pragmatic politics becomes a hallmark of his reign.</p>

                        <p><strong>1778</strong> - Leads the War of the Bavarian Succession, a largely bloodless conflict resolved through clever maneuvering rather than costly battles, reflecting Frederick’s growing preference for strategy over brute force.</p>

                        <p><strong>1780</strong> - Implements reforms aimed at modernizing Prussia, including promoting religious tolerance, expanding education, and reforming the legal system. His policies reflect his commitment to Enlightenment ideals, earning him the title of "Philosopher King."</p>

                        <p><strong>1786</strong> - Dies on August 17 at the age of 74 at Sanssouci. Known for his sharp intellect, military brilliance, and dedication to the arts, Frederick leaves behind a Prussia transformed into a European powerhouse.</p>
